# Dcupl Nuxt Starter

## Intro
This project is an Angular starter template integrating [dcupl](https://docs.dcupl.com) for client-side data filtering. It uses data and models from the **"Product Catalog"** console project. You can start by exploring the provided data and models and even create your own console project based on the Starter Catalog to update data and models as needed.

## Loading Your Own Data
To load data from the dcupl CDN, open the `dcupl.instance.ts` file. Youâ€™ll find the **projectId** and **apiKey** fields there, which are used to configure and authenticate the data load process. Update these fields with your own project's **projectId** and **apiKey** once you've set up a new console project.
